*Syndicate* is a task queue implementation backed by a pool of worker threads. Get it? Syndicate? Lots of workers? Damn, I'm so smart.

It follows the usual C header library style: you choose one .c file to hold the implementation. Besides that, It depends on *twine*, another of my little C libs, so you have to do something like this:

#+begin_src C 

#define SYNDICATE_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "../path/to/twine.h"

#include "twine.h"

#+end_src

A real readme is forthcoming.
